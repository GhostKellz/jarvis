# üö¶ Jarvis ROADMAP.md

A phased plan for building Jarvis: the next-gen AI DevOps/dev agent‚Äîmodular, persistent, privacy-aware, and blockchain-native.

---

## Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Agent & Basic AI

* [ ] Jarvis Core library (modular, Rust)
* [ ] CLI shell and agent (jarvis-shell, jarvis-agent)
* [ ] NVim integration (jarvis-nvim minimal plugin)
* [ ] Basic LLM/AI integration (Ollama, Claude, OpenAI via LiteLLM or custom)
* [ ] CLI skills: code explain, edit, refactor, search, fetch docs
* [ ] Persistent local memory (zqlite/Sled)

## Phase 2 ‚Äì System Awareness & Automation

* [ ] System/infra context gathering (CPU, GPU, OS, network, etc)
* [ ] Self-update and auto-upgrade logic
* [ ] OS & package audit (Linux, Windows, Mac)
* [ ] Project/repo watcher: audit, status, code health
* [ ] Plugin/script execution: Bash, Python, Zig, Rust
* [ ] Skill registry and hot-reloadable extensions
* [ ] Network traversal and discovery (IPv6/QUIC native)
* [ ] Proxmox and LXC container orchestration
* [ ] Wazuh/CrowdSec integration for security monitoring
* [ ] Docker Compose agent deployment system
* [ ] Bandwidth and network condition monitoring
* [ ] Gas fee tracking and blockchain metrics 

## Phase 3 ‚Äì Distributed Agent & Security

* [ ] Jarvis mesh: agent-to-agent communication (QUIC, gRPC)
* [ ] Multi-agent coordination and task distribution
* [ ] Agent deployment orchestration (Docker Swarm, K8s, LXC clusters)
* [ ] Inter-agent discovery and health monitoring
* [ ] Memory synchronization and device graph
* [ ] GhostChain blockchain integration: audit, wallet, smart contracts
* [ ] Zig blockchain support and cross-chain bridge monitoring
* [ ] Real-time blockchain security analysis with AI
* [ ] Secrets management: GhostVault integration
* [ ] Role-based identity, user profiles, multi-device control
* [ ] Dynamic model selection and LLM optimization
* [ ] Agent specialization (network monitor, security auditor, gas optimizer) 

## Phase 4 ‚Äì Next-Gen AI, Multi-Model, and DApps

* [ ] Dynamic model selection (any local LLM via Ollama or external API)
* [ ] Agent ‚Äúpersonas,‚Äù memory, and specialized skills
* [ ] gRPC-native API (replace/augment REST)
* [ ] Jarvis as a service: remote agent, cloud, or mesh orchestrator
* [ ] dApp bridge: GhostChain/Enoch smart contract support
* [ ] Web/GUI dashboard (optional, privacy-first)

---
## Phase 5 - API/protocol:

   REST is not future-proof. You want gRPC or even your own QUIC-native protocol for:

    Real-time, high-throughput agent-to-agent and LLM interactions

    ‚ÄúPlug-and-play‚Äù model switching (Claude, Ollama, OpenAI, Gemini‚Ä¶)

    Rich streaming (logs, memory, code, audits), not just chat.
## Phase 6 ‚Äì Advanced AI Agent Infrastructure

* [ ] IPv6/QUIC native blockchain overlay network
* [ ] AI-powered economic optimization (gas fees, resource allocation)
* [ ] Cross-chain interoperability monitoring and automation
* [ ] Self-healing infrastructure with predictive maintenance
* [ ] Advanced threat detection using multi-agent ML models
* [ ] Autonomous smart contract auditing and deployment
* [ ] Dynamic network topology optimization

## Stretch Goals / Advanced

* [ ] Self-hosted secure web dashboard
* [ ] Full GhostMesh integration (blockchain identity, trust)
* [ ] Plug-and-play for new models (Claude, Gemini, local LLMs)
* [ ] Multi-agent team orchestration (for CI/CD, SRE, security)
* [ ] Natural language automations ("upgrade all repos & servers", "scan for CVEs")
* [ ] Quantum-resistant cryptography integration
* [ ] AI agent marketplace on GhostChain

*This roadmap evolves as Jarvis gains skills and the ecosystem matures.*
