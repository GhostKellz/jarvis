# 💡 Jarvis BRAINSTORM.md

A working scratchpad for vision, ideas, and killer features to guide Jarvis’ evolution as the world’s most useful DevOps/infra/AI agent.

---

## 🔥 Vision

* AI agent that’s **always-on, persistent, learns your stack**
* Knows your code, servers, and workflows
* **Knows YOU**: context, identity, preferences, coding style
* First agent you actually *trust* with real access—can sign, verify, automate
* Core to the GhostMesh / GhostChain ecosystem

## 🤖 Next-Gen Features

* **Memory:** Never forgets a project, conversation, or audit. Indexes everything—fast retrieval
* **Skill Engine:** Extensible skills/plugins for everything (code, infra, chat, data science, dApps)
* **Device Graph:** Knows all your machines, networks, GPU/CPU, and OS context
* **Autonomous Tasks:** Self-updating, can patch, restart, or upgrade itself and other services
* **Agent Mesh:** Multiple Jarvis nodes share skills/memories; can collaborate on tasks
* **Persona/Mode Switching:** From coder to auditor to AI research assistant on demand

## ⚡️ Integrations

* **LLM/AI:** Pluggable LLM backend: local (Ollama), remote (Claude, OpenAI), run Jarvis *on top* of any
* **gRPC/QUIC:** Modern API: drop REST in favor of gRPC-native, QUIC transport, or even your own protocol
* **Memory:** zqlite (Zig SQLite), Sled, Postgres, or Redis for persistence
* **VFS:** Virtual filesystem for logs, configs, ephemeral/project data
* **Security:** Key signing, on-chain identity, audit trails, GhostVault for secrets
* **NVim & Editor plugins:** Jarvis-nvim (Claude-Code++), VSCode (later), TUI/CLI

## 🦾 Real-World Use Cases

* “Refactor this project, open PR, notify team”
* “Scan all servers for updates/CVEs, auto-patch”
* “Summarize project history & TODOs from last month”
* “Act as a build/test runner for any repo”
* “Deploy AI/ML workflow on demand”
* “Bridge data or sign artifacts on GhostChain”

## 🧠 Open Questions

* How to safely expose agent abilities to remote users? (signing, ACLs, user consent)
* Memory management: per-project, per-user, shared, encrypted?
* Multi-model abstraction: dynamically pick best LLM for context?
* Do we build a thin wrapper over LiteLLM or a full custom gRPC stack for next-gen agent?
* Can we hot-swap agents/personalities or containerize skills?

## 🚀 Stretch/Wild Ideas

* Distributed agent team (run Jarvis swarm as a CI/CD orchestrator or SRE team)
* On-chain agent markets or open skill/plugin stores
* “AI Copilot for homelab/cloud”—proactive, not reactive
* Audit mode: run system or project audits and write results to blockchain
