## Development Principles

1. **Security First**: Every feature must pass security review
2. **Privacy by Default**: No telemetry without explicit opt-in
3. **Local First**: Must work fully offline with local models
4. **Extensible**: Plugin architecture from day one
5. **Fast**: Sub-second response times for common operations
6. **Reliable**: Graceful degradation, never corrupt user data
7. **Accessible**: Works in terminal, GUI, and screenreaders

## Dependencies & Risks

### Technical Dependencies
- GhostLLM completion (blocks LLM routing)
- zqlite library completion (github.com/ghostkellz/zqlite)
- Ollama stability for local inference
- Neovim 0.10+ for plugin features
- Rust async ecosystem maturity

### External Risks
- API pricing changes from providers
- Model availability and deprecation
- Competing products (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
- Regulatory changes around AI tools

### Mitigation Strategies
- Provider abstraction layer
- Local model fallbacks
- Feature flags for experimental code
- Regular security audits
- Active community engagement
