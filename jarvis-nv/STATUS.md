   - Blockchain monitoring and analytics
   - Health checks and performance metrics

3. **AI Agent** (`src/agent.rs`)
   - Anomaly detection
   - Performance optimization
   - Predictive analytics
   - Learning and adaptation

4. **Metrics Collector** (`src/metrics.rs`)
   - Prometheus metrics
   - System monitoring
   - Performance tracking
   - HTTP API for metrics

5. **GhostBridge** (`src/bridge.rs`)

   - Monitoring and alerting

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75+ (edition 2024)
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Optional: Docker with NVIDIA runtime

### Build Commands

```bash
# Basic build (no GPU features)
cargo build --no-default-features --features web5

# Full build with GPU support (requires CUDA)
cargo build --features gpu,node-integration,web5

# Development build
cargo check
```

### Running

```bash
# Start the daemon
cargo run -- start

# Check status
cargo run -- status

# GPU information
cargo run -- gpu-info

# Run benchmark
cargo run -- benchmark
```

## Configuration

The application uses a comprehensive configuration system with environment variable support:

```toml
[gpu]
enabled = true
device_id = 0
benchmark_on_startup = false

[node]
ghostchain_enabled = true
zvm_enabled = true
ghostchain_url = "http://localhost:8545"

[web5]
enabled = true
bind_address = "[::]:3000"
quic_enabled = true
http3_enabled = true

[metrics]
enabled = true
prometheus_enabled = true
bind_address = "127.0.0.1:9090"

[bridge]
enabled = true
grpc_bind_address = "[::]:50051"
quic_bind_address = "[::]:4433"

[agent]
enabled = true
anomaly_detection = true
performance_optimization = true
predictive_analytics = true
```

## Development Notes

### Known Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**: The current codebase has compilation errors due to:
   - Missing optional dependencies when features are disabled
   - Unsafe code patterns in async contexts
   - Type mismatches in networking code

2. **Simulation vs Reality**: Most functionality is currently simulated for development purposes

3. **Dependencies**: Some dependencies need version alignment and feature configuration

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Compilation**: Resolve current build errors with proper conditional compilation
2. **Implement Core Features**: Replace simulations with real implementations
3. **Integration Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for all modules
4. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and user guides
5. **Deployment**: Create Docker images and deployment scripts

## Contributing

The project is structured to allow incremental development:

1. Each module can be developed independently
2. Simulation stubs allow testing without hardware dependencies
3. Feature flags enable selective compilation
4. Comprehensive configuration supports various deployment scenarios

This foundation provides a solid starting point for building a production-ready GPU-accelerated AI agent for blockchain node operations.
